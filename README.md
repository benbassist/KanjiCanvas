# KanjiCanvas

HTML canvas based Kanji (Japanese characters) input mechanism.  Draw a kanji character on the canvas, hit submit and the program will reveal closest matches based on stroke order, angle and relative size of each stroke.

To try it out clone project and open KanjiCanvas.html

To run tests: 'npm install' then 'npm test'

'npm install' probably won't work in windows.  Try linux.
